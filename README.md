# Penalty-Game

This repository contains two versions of a simple penalty shootout game.

- **penalty_game.py** – command line version where you type `l`, `m` or `r` to shoot left, middle or right.
- **penalty_game_gui.py** – Pygame version where you click inside the goal to shoot and watch the keeper dive.

Install the required dependency and run the graphical game with:

```bash
pip install pygame
python3 penalty_game_gui.py
```

Use the mouse to click one of the three sections of the goal. The game ends when the keeper guesses your corner.
